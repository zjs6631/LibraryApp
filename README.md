# LibraryApp
Library app to hold book objects and their properties
This Library app is built using HTML/CSS/Javascript

-- I refactored the JS to use classes to create the book objects
-- Each book has attributes for name, author, pages, and completion status
-- This information is collected via a modal form and displayed on a grid tile for the user
-- status button allows user to mark book as completed/in progress

--a few things to refactor in the future would be to just create the book object and see if it is possible to just append it to the grid
  --and if it will fall into place on the grid
--another thing to refactor would be to tweak the grid sizing to make it more dynamic. It is currently a 4x4 grid. Decided to keep things simple while working out the Javascript logic.
--one more thing will be to re-do the UI/UX to make it more appealing. image background came out a little tacky, so will address this in the future.
